Lambda UI
==========
__Status:__

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sroidl/lambda-ui.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sroidl/lambda-ui)[![Heroku](https://heroku-badge.herokuapp.com/?app=heroku-badge)](http://lambdaui-snapshot.herokuapp.com/lambdaui)

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/lambdaui/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/lambdaui)

LambdaUI is a new User Interface for the build tool [LambdaCD](https://github.com/flosell/lambdacd). It's a single-page application (SPA) based on React/Redux.

See and play with the latest build on [Heroku](http://lambdaui-snapshot.herokuapp.com/lambdaui). Just use the the `Start Build` button and explore all the features.

## Features
1. Quick overview of all recent builds:

2. Explore details of your Builds:

3. Have a look at your build step output if it's necessary:

### Coming up:

* Websockets! Get your build information asap. Instead of polling the results of a build, the server will push new events to the clients.  
* Support all types of build step results (currently only the output)
* Support of browser history within the app.

## Usage
As this project is only the User Interface, you'll need running [LambdaCD](https://github.com/flosell/lambdacd) pipeline. The minimum required version of LambdaCD is currently `0.13.3`. To use LambdaUI, you'll also need to use the [http-kit](http://www.http-kit.org/) (we tested it with v2.2.0) webserver to serve the backend of the UI.

### Step-by-Step setup
We'll suppose you've setup your pipeline as in the [example by LambdaCD](http://www.lambda.cd/getting-started/)

1. In your `project.clj` require _http-kit_ and _lambdaui_:

``` clojure
; ...
:dependencies [ ;...
              [lambdaui "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]
              [http-kit "2.2.0"]]
; ...
```

2. In your `core.clj` switch to the new ui:

``` clojure
(ns your.pipeline.core
  (:require [ ; [...]

              ; [lambdacd.ui.ui-server :as ui] -- Replace this by
              [lambdaui.core :as ui]

              ; [ring.server.standalone :as ring-server] -- Replace by
              [org.httpkit.server :as http-kit]
              ; [...]
            ]))

; [...]

(defn -main [args]
  ;[...]

  ; Replace
  ; (ring-server/serve ring-handler {:open-browser? false
  ;                                   :port 8080})
  ; with
  (http-kit/run-server ring-handler { :open-browser? false
                                      :port 8080})
)


```

That's it! Now start the pipeline as usual and have a look the new UI:
`http://localhost:8080/lambdaui`

__Note:__ The old UI is served as a fallback for your convenience as the default UI at `http://localhost:8080`. 


Also, have a look at the [example-pipeline](https://github.com/sroidl/lambda-ui/tree/master/example-pipeline) for a complete code example.

### Configuration

You can modify your UI by adding an entry to your pipeline config:

``` clojure
; in your -main function:

config {:home-dir home-dir
        :name "some pipeline"   ; Will be used in the UI header.
        :ui-config {            ; Configure the UI here
                    :navbar {
                      :links [ {:url "http://localhost:8080/" :text "Old UI"}]
                    }}

       }
```

#### Supported options

##### __:contextPath__
This option is necessary, if your UI is not served at the root path of your webserver. The easiest way to set this prefix is by passing the `:contextPath` option to the `ui-for` function.

Example:
```clojure

  ;setup webserver routes with compojure
  (def routes (routes
                (context "/my-pipeline" []
                  (ui/ui-for pipeline :contextPath "/my-pipeline"))))

```

##### __:navbar__
Configure the navigation bar (next to the Header) with custom links (see above). `:links` is expected to be a sequence.

`:link`
 A link for the navigation bar in the header can have three keys:
 - `:url`  - relative or absolute URL
 - `:text` - Text shown
 - `:target` (optional, since 0.2.0) - Set the target for the link. Defaults to `_blank` . Change this to `""` if you don't like your links to be opened in a new browser tab.

##### __:showStartBuildButton__ _(experimental)_ - default: `false`
If set to `true`, a button is shown in the Header that allows to trigger a new build. This is only necessary if you don't use a pipeline runner with a waiting trigger step.
__NOTE:__ This feature is experimental and can disappear in any future version.

##### __:show-version__ - default: `false`
If set to `true`  serves another endpoint at `[prefix]/lambdaui/version` and reports the current version of LambdaUI that is used.

Thanks for your helping hand!

### Getting Started

#### Development
Use the _go_ script to run the necessary build steps:

1. `./go setup` -- Run to update npm dependencies. Only required once.
2. `./go serve-ui` -- Runs a webserver thats serves the frontend on port 8080. Watches the frontend folder for changes and rebundles them on the fly.
3. `./go serve-backend` -- Runs a webserver that serves the backend-for-frontend with dummy data.
4. `./go push` -- runs `./go test` and `git push` if tests were successful.

5. `./go jar` -- Compiles the project and packs everything into the current jar of lambdaui. Those are located in `backend/target/lambdaui-{version}-[qualifier].jar` (e.g. _backend/target/lambdaui-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT_)

##### Directory Structure

* `backend` contains the clojure project that's being published as a plugin to LambdaCD
* `frontend` contains the JS based UI part of the Plugin.

##### API for Frontend.
To manipulate the dummy data of the backend, edit _dummy_data.clj_ and restart the backend server with `./go serve-backend`.
If you're already familiar with Clojure development, you can also start the server in a REPL and edit the dummy data without restarting.

Also see `./go help` for further goals.
You can also use the NPM targets when inside the _resources/ui_ folder.
